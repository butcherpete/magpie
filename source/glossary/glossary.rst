  Sphinx
    Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. It was originally created for the Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages.

  interpreted text
    Interpreted text is text that is meant to be related, indexed, linked, summarized, or otherwise processed, but the text itself is typically left alone. Interpreted text is enclosed by single backquote characters. http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#interpreted-text

  role
    Roles all have a common syntax, based on the interpreted text feature of reStructuredText. 

  role processor
    The docutils parser works by converting the input text to an internal tree representation made up of different types of nodes. The tree is traversed by a writer to create output in the desired format. To add a directive or role, you need to provide the hooks to be called to handle the markup when it is encountered in the input file. A role processor is defined with a function that takes arguments describing the marked-up text and returns the nodes to be included in the parse tree.

  RST
    |rst| is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plain text markup syntax and parser system. It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. |rst| is designed for extensibility for specific application domains. The |rst| parser is a component of Docutils.

  Sublime Text
    Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.

  template 
    Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via themes. A theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static files. Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which theme to inherit, which highlighting style to use, and what options exist for customizing the theme’s look and feel.
