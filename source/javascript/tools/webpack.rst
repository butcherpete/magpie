  At its core, webpack is a :emphasis:`static module bundler` for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

Webpack is a build tool that can be run from the command line via a JavaScript configuration file (:code:`webpack-config.js`).

- Webpack enable JavaScript code to be compiled.
- Webpack allows npm packages to be used with browser code.

- Code splitting for smart bundling of code into smaller packages.
