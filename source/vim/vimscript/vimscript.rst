"Vim's scripting language, known as Vimscript, is a typical dynamic imperative language and offers most of the usual language features: variables, expressions, control structures, built-in functions, user-defined functions, first-class strings, high-level data structures (lists and dictionaries), terminal and file I/O, regex pattern matching, exceptions, and an integrated debugger."
